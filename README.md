## Oddly Satisfying Clock

A rather unconventional clock inspired by [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/lsa654/this_clock_hitting_midnight_is_oddly_satisfying/). This Single Page Web Application was built using the javascript framework, react.js. [Here](https://oddly-satisfying-clock.web.app/) is the link for the firebase web app.

### Some Reflections

I did this project during the early days of my summer vacation in 2021, partly because I was bored and partly because I wanted to do something - something useful. I did this project to take the basic concepts I knew about react.js home and to implement some new features by refering to the documentation. Plus, it would look good on my portfolio, wouldn't it?

I saw the reddit post I mentioned earlier and wanted to replicate it. But, I didn't know where to start. After some days, thanks to the [front page of react](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/), I saw couple of projects that implemented this idea. With them as guidance, I was able to complete this and I was also able to implement some additional features. I started this using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding some components.

One of the main challenges I ran into was implementing the AM/PM toggle. With some thinking, the help of react.js documentation, material-ui documentation, and react-icons documentation and thanks to the usual suspect - stackoverflow, I was able to do this without much of a trouble. I also hosted this app in the cloud platform Firebase.
